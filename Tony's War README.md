"Of war, the game is always with him who makes the fewest mistakes."  
So said Napolean, and it is my intention to be victorious!

Tony's War is a variant of the childhood card game "War" in which the object is to obtain all of the cards.  To achieve this illustrious goal, the player who shows the highest card wins the battle and keeps the cards displayed.  Tony's War deviates from the original game by simply annotating a tie as a "Draw".  Below, is a screenshot of this game "in-play" and a sample of the corresponding code of JavaScript.
